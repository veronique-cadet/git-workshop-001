// Git Workflow

Rule: Never work on the main/ master branch

2.Name your branches like this:
your-name/feature-you-are-working-on
vero/signup-form 

git checkout -b branchname

git branch name 

3.Set upstream 
Point this branch to a remote branch on github to the gh to track changes going forward
git push -u origin 

GENERAL WORKFLOW:
git status
git add
git commit -m "commit message"
git push

Commits should be <small></small>
"Commit early, commit often"
